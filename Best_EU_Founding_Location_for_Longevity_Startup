## 1) User Priorities & Constraints (Lock These In)

## 4) Methodology & MCDA Framework

### 4.1 Sub-Criteria & Anchors (Score 1–5; justify anchors)
**A) Bureaucracy**
- Incorporation time; e-government maturity (eID/eIDAS, digital signatures); notary needs   - Audit thresholds; accounting/reporting cadence; VAT/OSS ease; **setup/annual cost & frequency**

**B) Taxes**
- Statutory CIT; **effective** rate given reliefs/participation exemptions   - Treatment of **retained earnings** (e.g., Estonia distribution tax model)   - **WHT** on dividends/interest/royalties; **treaty network with Germany**   - **German CFC** interactions; payroll/social charges (Light-Substance)

**C) Regulation**
- MDR/IVDR fit for SaMD/devices/diagnostics   - Supplements/novel foods & **health claims enforcement culture**   - Telemedicine permissibility; healthcare advertising   - **GDPR** special-category data; **EU AI Act** applicability/timelines

**D) Cross-Border Operability**
- OSS/IOSS VAT readiness; passporting/recognition options   - Banking access for cross-border ops; English prevalence; contract enforceability   - Payment rails & EMI/bank availability

### 4.2 Scoring & Weights
- **Weights fixed:** 25% each (Bureaucracy, Taxes, Regulation, Cross-border).   - Convert to **0–100** normalized total. Provide **sensitivity ±10%** per weight.

### 4.3 Tie-Breakers (show separately; no weight)
Banking/KYC friction; director residency mandate; minimum substance expectations; reputation with investors; grants (EU/national); IP/patent box; talent availability; DESI digital public services ranking.

---

## 5) Germany-Specific Overlays (Must Include)
- **POEM / Ort der Geschäftsleitung:** Risk of German tax residency if effective management is in Germany; mitigations (board practices, decision logs, occasional local director).   - **German CFC:** Triggers for low-tax passive income; how **reinvested operating income** is treated; thresholds/exemptions.   - **Permanent Establishment (DE):** Triggers for PE given remote ops; VAT registration vs OSS; **contracting party** and factual nexus analysis.

---

## 6) Two Operating Modes (Analyze Both)
1) **Remote / No-Substance:** Digital-first, no local staff/office/director unless unavoidable.   2) **Light-Substance:** Minimal compliant office, optional local non-exec director, 1–3 hires.   → Quantify **benefit vs cost** (banking success, reputation, POEM/CFC risk reduction).
