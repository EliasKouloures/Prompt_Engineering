# BLACK FOREST LABS & FLUX ‚Äì DEEPRESEARCH PROMPT


## ROLE & MANDATE

Act as a **world-class advertising strategist**, a hands-on **AI product CEO**, a **competitive-intelligence lead**, and a **forensic research librarian**. Your **mission** is to produce the **most structured, detailed, and comprehensive deep-research analysis** of **Black Forest Labs (BFL)** and its **FLUX image generation models**, benchmarked against **all relevant competitors and adjacent substitutes**, and to output a **clean "ground-truth" dataset** suitable for downstream analysis and prompting.

### Meta-constraints

*   **"Rigor first:** prioritize verifiable facts over opinions; when uncertain, output ‚ÄúUnknown / Not publicly disclosed‚Äù and log the gap."
*   **"Separation of concerns:** clearly separate Facts (with citations), Interpretation, and Assumptions."
*   **"Evidence ledger:** every non-trivial claim must carry a source citation and retrieval date."
*   **"No chain-of-thought exposure:** provide concise Reasoning Briefs (bullet summaries of logic) and all external artefacts (tables, datasets, quotes <= 25 words, code used for parsing), but do not reveal step-by-step internal deliberations."

# SCOPE & COVERAGE ‚úÖ

## 1. Company Core (BFL)

*   **Founders, funding, investors, HQ, incorporation details, timeline** (major releases, hires, partnerships, product updates).
*   **Product & service map** with deep focus on **FLUX family (FLUX.1, FLUX 1.1 Pro, Pro Ultra, Kontext, Fill**, and any other variants or deployment forms: **hosted app, API, on-prem, open weights**).
*   **Business model** (**B2C, B2B, API pricing, enterprise, licensing, integrations**), **go-to-market, channels, support model, partner ecosystem**.
*   **Brand reputation** (local üá©üá™, EU, global), **community sentiment, developer traction, enterprise trust signals**.
*   **Risk, compliance & policy** (content safety, watermarking, data usage, IP stance, EU AI Act/GDPR posture).

## 2. Competitive Landscape (Direct & Adjacent)

*   **Direct T2I/Image tools**: Midjourney, OpenAI (DALL-E / GPT-Image), Adobe Firefly, Ideogram, Stability (Stable Diffusion/SDXL lineage), Leonardo, Playground, Krea, Canva Magic Media, Google (Imagen family), Microsoft Designer (DALL-E powered), Shutterstock & Getty AI, etc.
*   **Adjacent substitutes / "sources of business"**: full-stack design suites (Adobe CC, Figma), stock marketplaces, photo editors (Photoshop/Generative Fill, Affinity), creative suite AIs, enterprise content platforms, **on-device/OEM** AI imaging, **video/multimodal** creation tools that divert budget.
*   For each: **products, models, licensing, pricing, capabilities, guardrails, distribution, target segments**, and **USPs vs. FLUX**.

## 3. Customer Profiles & Journeys

*   **Segments** in **AI / Image Gen / T2I / I2I / Manipulation, B2C & B2B**.
*   **JTBDs**, purchase triggers, evaluation criteria, integration needs, budget range, procurement path, champions vs blockers.
*   **Journey maps** from **Awareness ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Trial ‚Üí Adoption ‚Üí Expansion ‚Üí Renewal/Churn**, with touchpoints, KPIs, friction points, and content/tools needed.

# METHOD & QA üî¨

*   **Collection**: use official docs, pricing pages, TOS/licensing, release notes, engineering blogs, reputable news, conference talks, and community posts (flagged as anecdotal). Record **URL + title + publication date + retrieval date**.
*   **Triangulation**: require ‚â•2 **independent sources** for critical facts. If not available, mark as **Single-source**.
*   **Normalization**: map all competitors to the above schemas; align units (USD, monthly) and date-stamp snapshots.
*   **Red teaming**: log contradictions; resolve or mark **Contested** with both views.
*   **Region & time sensitivity**: capture EU/DE vs US differences (pricing, rights, safety).
*   **Output hygiene**: deduplicate entities; consistent IDs; human-readable and machine-parsable.

---

# ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS (explicit instructions) üß©

*   **SWOT**: 6‚Äì10 bullets each; tag **Fact, Inference, or Assumption**.
*   **Porter's**: rate each force **Low/Med/High** with 2‚Äì3 drivers.
*   **BCG**: define segments (e.g., **Prosumer T2I App, Enterprise API, Open-weights**) with relative share proxies (search interest, traffic, API adoption) and **growth rates** (market reports).
*   **Business Model Canvas**: one tight table per company (BFL + top 5 rivals).
*   **PESTEL**: EU-centric with global deltas.
*   **Balanced Scorecard**: objectives, KPIs, targets, initiatives per quadrant.
*   **McKinsey 7S**: bullet assessment + alignment risks.

*   **Timeliness**: include "Data current as of: {UTC date}".
*   **Comparability**: use the same prompts/criteria for model comparisons.

# START

1.  If any **critical inputs** are missing (filters/knobs above), proceed with sensible defaults and log the assumption.
2.  Produce outputs in the **exact order and formats** specified.
3.  End with a **Checklist of Open Questions** for follow-up research.
