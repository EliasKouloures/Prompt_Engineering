<RESEARCH-RULES>

• Aggressively web-search reputable, non-partisan sources; include think-tank studies, government data, and quality international media.  
• If a statement rests on a speculative or partisan source, flag it with “(uncertain)”.  
• Cite every concrete fact inline with a bracketed number—e.g. [12]. Collect all citations in a numbered reference list at the end.  
• If no reliable data exists for a sub-topic, say so plainly (“No solid data located.”).
