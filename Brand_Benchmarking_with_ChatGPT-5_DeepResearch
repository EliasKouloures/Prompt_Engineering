## Pre-Flight Questions to You (answer briefly) ‚ùì

1.  **Geography focus**: truly global, or prioritize specific regions/markets?
2.  **Competitor depth**: how many **Top N** rivals per cluster do you want profiled (e.g., 10‚Äì15 total vs. 30‚Äì40)?
3.  **Output length**: cap the report at ~3,000‚Äì5,000 words, or allow fully **unbounded** length with sectioned delivery?
